- ROUTING
- do we really need routing??
- decide which type of transition to use when navigating from a main to details screen, e.g. the settings in NGL
- keep native android/ios screens/UI minimal as possible, to have full control and remote updates.
- ask the user to connect to the internet if they are not, you don't have to handle that.
- encourage IOS users to add the webApp to their home screen.
- check internet connection and handle offline state by service workers.
