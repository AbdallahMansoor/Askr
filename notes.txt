- ask for what is the best and cost saving way for my design of backend where I just need to process the first request with a programming language to detect if it's IOS or Android, then serve the static app files.
- keep native android/ios screens/UI minimal as possible, to have full control and remote updates.
- ask the user to connect to the internet if they are not. use service workers for the offline page.
- encourage IOS users to add the webApp to their home screen.
